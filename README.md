# Econ3D-MAPF

**Hierarchical Priority-Based Multi-Agent Pathfinding with Economic Mechanisms in 3D Space**

A comprehensive research framework that advances multi-agent pathfinding (MAPF) through priority-driven hierarchical processing, economic optimization, and true three-dimensional spatial reasoning with specific focus on low-altitude airspace applications.

## Project Overview

Econ3D-MAPF represents a paradigm shift in multi-agent pathfinding research, moving beyond traditional equal-priority approaches to embrace realistic hierarchical agent classification with integrated economic decision-making. Building upon proven airspace management foundations, this system introduces novel theoretical and practical contributions to the MAPF field through priority-based processing, 3D spatial optimization, and market-driven resource allocation.

### Low-Altitude Airspace: The Perfect 3D MAPF Application Domain

Low-altitude airspace represents an ideal real-world application for 3D MAPF research due to several unique characteristics:

#### üåê **Natural 3D Environment**
- **Unrestricted Vertical Movement**: Unlike ground-based robotics, aircraft can move freely in all three dimensions
- **Altitude Layering**: Natural stratification allows for traffic separation and conflict reduction
- **Volumetric Pathfinding**: True 3D path optimization with meaningful altitude choices affecting efficiency and safety

#### üöÅ **Inherent Priority Hierarchies** 
- **Emergency Services**: Medical helicopters, search and rescue, police operations require absolute priority
- **Commercial Operations**: Delivery drones, inspection services, cargo transport with varying urgency levels
- **Recreational Activities**: Hobby drones, sightseeing, recreational flying with lowest priority
- **Critical Infrastructure**: Power line inspection, emergency response, public safety missions

#### üí∞ **Economic Resource Scarcity**
- **Limited Airspace Capacity**: Physical constraints create natural resource competition
- **Regulatory Compliance Costs**: Certification, insurance, and operational overhead create economic factors
- **Time-Sensitive Operations**: Delivery windows, emergency response times create willingness-to-pay differentials
- **Efficiency Premiums**: Direct routes vs. longer paths represent clear economic trade-offs

#### üéØ **Complex Operational Requirements**
- **Weather Dependencies**: Dynamic obstacle avoidance for weather systems
- **No-Fly Zones**: Static and temporary airspace restrictions
- **Noise Constraints**: Community impact limitations on flight paths
- **Energy Optimization**: Battery life constraints require efficient 3D pathfinding
